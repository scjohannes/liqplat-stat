## README

This is the repository for the statistical analyses of the [LIQPLAT trial](https://liqplat.com).

-   qol-sap.qmd details the statistical analyses for quality of life. The code that was used to create all figures and tables can be found in the folder 1-qol/. Access to a hisotrical dataset is needed to run the code. The simulated datasets might be shared at a later stage to make steps 5 - 7 reproducible.
