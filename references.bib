  abstract = "IMPORTANCE: Personalized medicine based on tumor profiling and
              identification of actionable genomic alterations is pivotal in
              cancer management. Although tissue biopsy is still preferred for
              diagnosis, liquid biopsy of blood-based tumor analytes, such as
              circulating tumor DNA, is a rapidly emerging technology for tumor
              profiling. OBSERVATIONS: This review presents a practical overview
              for clinicians and allied health care professionals for selection
              of the most appropriate liquid biopsy assay, specifically focusing
              on circulating tumor DNA and how it may affect patient treatment
              and case management across multiple tumor types. Multiple factors
              influence the analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical
              utility of testing. This review provides recommendations and
              practical guidance for best practice. Current methodologies
              include polymerase chain reaction-based approaches and those that
              use next-generation sequencing (eg, capture-based profiling, whole
              exome, or genome sequencing). Factors that may influence utility
              include sensitivity and specificity, quantity of circulating tumor
              DNA, detection of a small vs a large panel of genes, and clonal
              hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. Currently, liquid biopsy
              appears useful in patients unable to undergo biopsy or where
              mutations detected may be more representative of the predominant
              tumor burden than for tissue-based assays. Other potential
              applications may include screening, primary diagnosis, residual
              disease, local recurrence, therapy selection, or early therapy
              response and resistance monitoring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
              This review found that liquid biopsy is increasingly being used
              clinically in advanced lung cancer, and ongoing research is
              identifying applications of circulating tumor DNA-based testing
              that complement tissue analysis across a broad range of clinical
              settings. Circulating tumor DNA technologies are advancing quickly
              and are demonstrating potential benefits for patients, health care
              practitioners, health care systems, and researchers, at many
              stages of the patient oncologic journey.",

              and safety of antihypertensive drugs, involving more than 40,000
              patients internationally. Much has been learned and should be
              applied to future studies. First, patient selection: will
              selection of patients from different races and nationalities
              permit pooling of data? There should be a sufficient number of
              female patients and elderly patients above 80 years of age to draw
              unequivocal conclusions about the effectiveness of
              antihypertensive treatment in that population. Further, will the
              patient population reflect the population cared for by individual
              community practitioners? End-points must be carefully selected,
              and it will be important to prove not only that a specific drug
              can lower blood pressure, but also how far blood pressure should
              be lowered. Lowering of blood pressure per se is not enough, and
              end-points should involve all-cause mortality and specific
              mortalities. Data analysis may revolve around intention to treat
              analysis or on-treatment analysis. Regarding side effects of the
              study drug, consideration should be given to survival statistics.
              Finally, decision analysis is needed. After the trial,
              postmarketing surveillance is important, and patient selection is
              just as important in that instance as it was in the original
              trial. Once the trial has been completed, careful meta-analysis is
              needed to answer the question still unanswered: can small
              multiple-centre trials replace large, international trials? One
              should not consider a trial completed unless measures have been
              suggested or taken to inform the practising clinician of the
              inferential statistics applied to the data and the meaning of the
              data analysis for the clinician in managing the individual
              patient.",

              clinical benefit from these therapies in order to avoid potential
              toxicities and reduce healthcare costs remains a clinical
              challenge. Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is shed by

              quantitative research, but currently none exist for the broad
              spectrum of qualitative research. The purpose of the present study
              was to formulate and define standards for reporting qualitative
              research while preserving the requisite flexibility to accommodate
              various paradigms, approaches, and methods. METHOD: The authors
              identified guidelines, reporting standards, and critical appraisal
              criteria for qualitative research by searching PubMed, Web of
              Science, and Google through July 2013; reviewing the reference
              lists of retrieved sources; and contacting experts. Specifically,
              two authors reviewed a sample of sources to generate an initial
              set of items that were potentially important in reporting
              qualitative research. Through an iterative process of reviewing
              sources, modifying the set of items, and coding all sources for
              items, the authors prepared a near-final list of items and
              descriptions and sent this list to five external reviewers for
              feedback. The final items and descriptions included in the
              reporting standards reflect this feedback. RESULTS: The Standards
              for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) consists of 21 items.
              The authors define and explain key elements of each item and
              provide examples from recently published articles to illustrate
              ways in which the standards can be met. CONCLUSIONS: The SRQR aims
              to improve the transparency of all aspects of qualitative research
              by providing clear standards for reporting qualitative research.
              These standards will assist authors during manuscript preparation,
              editors and reviewers in evaluating a manuscript for potential
              publication, and readers when critically appraising, applying, and

              in care homes impacting their diet, quality of life, self-esteem,
              general health and well-being. The care home setting is complex
              and many factors may affect the successful implementation of oral
              care interventions. Exploring these factors and their embedded
              context is key to understanding how and why interventions may or
              may not be successfully implemented within their intended setting.
              OBJECTIVES: This methodology paper describes the approach to a
              theoretically informed process evaluation alongside a pragmatic
              randomised controlled trial, so as to understand contextual
              factors, how the intervention was implemented and important
              elements that may influence the pathways to impact. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: SENIOR is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial
              designed to improve the oral health of care home residents in the
              United Kingdom. The trial uses a complex intervention to promote
              and provide oral care for residents, including education and
              training for staff. RESULTS: An embedded, theoretically informed
              process evaluation, drawing on the PAHRIS framework and utilising
              a qualitative approach, will help to understand the important
              contextual factors within the care home that influence both the
              trial processes and the implementation of the intervention.
              CONCLUSION: Utilising an implementation framework as the basis for
              a theoretically informed process evaluation provides an approach
              that specifically focuses on the contextual factors that may
              influence and shape the pathways to impact a given complex
              intervention a priori, while also providing an understanding of
              how and why an intervention may be effective. This contrasts with
              the more common post hoc approach that only focuses on
              implementation after the empirical results have emerged.",

              RCTs in fields where recruitment is slow, multiple new (competing)
              interventions for the same condition have to be tested, new
              interventions are highly preferred by patients and doctors, and
              the risk of disappointment bias, cross-over, and contamination is
              considerable. To prevent these unwanted effects, the cohort
              multiple RCT provides information on randomization to the
              intervention group/arm only, and only after randomization (i.e.,
              prerandomization). To some, especially in a clinical setting, this
              is not ethically acceptable. In this article, we argue that
              prerandomization in the cohort multiple randomized controlled
              trial (cmRCT) can be avoided by adopting a staged-informed consent
              procedure. In the first stage, at entry into the cohort, all
              potential participants are asked for their informed consent to
              participate in a cohort study and broad consent to be either
              randomly selected to be approached for experimental interventions
              or to serve as control without further notice during participation
              in the cohort. In a second stage, at the initiation of an RCT
              within the cohort, informed consent to receive the intervention is
              then only sought in those randomly selected for the intervention
              arm. At the third stage, after completion of each RCT, all cohort
              participants receive aggregate disclosure of trial results. This
              staged-informed consent procedure avoids prerandomization in cmRCT
              and aims to keep participants actively engaged in the research

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In advanced oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative
              breast cancer, acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors
              frequently stems from ESR1-mutated subclones, which might be
              sensitive to fulvestrant. The PADA-1 trial aimed to show the
              efficacy of an early change in therapy on the basis of a rising
              ESR1 mutation in blood (bESR1mut), while assessing the global
              safety of combination fulvestrant and palbociclib. METHODS: We did
              a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in 83 hospitals in France.
              Women aged at least 18 years with oestrogen receptor-positive,
              HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative
              Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited and
              monitored for rising bESR1mut during first-line aromatase
              inhibitor (2¬∑5 mg letrozole, 1 mg anastrozole, or 25 mg
              exemestane, orally once per day, taken continuously) and
              palbociclib (125 mg orally once per day on days 1-21 of a 28-day
              cycle) therapy. Patients with newly present or increased bESR1mut
              in circulating tumour DNA and no synchronous disease progression
              were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue with the same therapy or
              to switch to fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on day 1 of each
              28-day cycle and on day 15 of cycle 1) and palbociclib (dosing
              unchanged). The randomisation sequence was generated within an
              interactive web response system using a minimisation method (with
              an 80\% random factor); patients were stratified according to
              visceral involvement (present or absent) and the time from
              inclusion to bESR1mut detection (<12 months or ‚â•12 months). The
              co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free
              survival from random assignment, analysed in the
              intention-to-treat population (ie, all randomly assigned
              patients), and grade 3 or worse haematological adverse events in
              all patients. The trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov
              (NCT03079011), and is now complete. FINDINGS: From March 22, 2017,
              to Jan 31, 2019, 1017 patients were included, of whom 279 (27\%)
              developed a rising bESR1mut and 172 (17\%) were randomly assigned
              to treatment: 88 to switching to fulvestrant and palbociclib and
              84 patients to continuing aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib. At
              database lock on July 31, 2021, randomly assigned patients had a
              median follow-up of 35¬∑3 months (IQR 29¬∑2-41¬∑4) from inclusion and
              26¬∑0 months (13¬∑8-34¬∑3) from random assignment. Median
              progression-free survival from random assignment was 11¬∑9 months
              (95\% CI 9¬∑1-13¬∑6) in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group versus
              5¬∑7 months (3¬∑9-7¬∑5) in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib
              group (stratified HR 0¬∑61, 0¬∑43-0¬∑86; p=0¬∑0040). The most frequent
              grade 3 or worse haematological adverse events were neutropenia
              (715 [70¬∑3\%] of 1017 patients), lymphopenia (66 [6¬∑5\%]), and
              thrombocytopenia (20 [2¬∑0\%]). The most common grade 3 or worse
              adverse events in step 2 were neutropenia (35 [41¬∑7\%] of 84
              patients in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group vs 39
              [44¬∑3\%] of 88 patients in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group)
              and lymphopenia (three [3¬∑6\%] vs four [4¬∑5\%]). 31 (3¬∑1\%)
              patients had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events related to
              treatment in the overall population. Three (1¬∑7\%) of 172 patients
              randomly assigned had one serious adverse event in step 2: one
              (1¬∑2\%) grade 4 neutropenia and one (1¬∑2\%) grade 3 fatigue among
              84 patients in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group, and
              one (1¬∑1\%) grade 4 neutropenia among 88 patients in the
              fulvestrant and palbociclib group. One death by pulmonary embolism
              in step 1 was declared as being treatment related. INTERPRETATION:
              PADA-1 is the first prospective randomised trial showing that the
              early therapeutic targeting of bESR1mut results in significant
              clinical benefit. Additionally, the original design explored in
              PADA-1 might help with tackling acquired resistance with new drugs
              in future trials. FUNDING: Pfizer.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon
              cancer continues to be debated. The presence of circulating tumor
              DNA (ctDNA) after surgery predicts very poor recurrence-free
              survival, whereas its absence predicts a low risk of recurrence.
              The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for ctDNA-positive patients
              is not well understood. METHODS: We conducted a trial to assess
              whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant
              chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk. Patients with
              stage II colon cancer were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
              have treatment decisions guided by either ctDNA results or
              standard clinicopathological features. For ctDNA-guided
              management, a ctDNA-positive result at 4 or 7 weeks after surgery
              prompted oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy.
              Patients who were ctDNA-negative were not treated. The primary
              efficacy end point was recurrence-free survival at 2 years. A key
              secondary end point was adjuvant chemotherapy use. RESULTS: Of the
              455 patients who underwent randomization, 302 were assigned to
              ctDNA-guided management and 153 to standard management. The median
              follow-up was 37 months. A lower percentage of patients in the
              ctDNA-guided group than in the standard-management group received
              adjuvant chemotherapy (15\% vs. 28\%; relative risk, 1.82; 95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.65). In the evaluation of
              2-year recurrence-free survival, ctDNA-guided management was
              noninferior to standard management (93.5\% and 92.4\%,
              respectively; absolute difference, 1.1 percentage points; 95\% CI,
              -4.1 to 6.2 [noninferiority margin, -8.5 percentage points]).
              Three-year recurrence-free survival was 86.4\% among
              ctDNA-positive patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and
              92.5\% among ctDNA-negative patients who did not. CONCLUSIONS: A
              ctDNA-guided approach to the treatment of stage II colon cancer
              reduced adjuvant chemotherapy use without compromising
              recurrence-free survival. (Supported by the Australian National

              cancer. The European Society for Medical Oncology convened an
              expert working group to review the analytical and clinical
              validity and utility of ctDNA assays. For patients with advanced
              cancer, validated and adequately sensitive ctDNA assays have
              utility in identifying actionable mutations to direct targeted
              therapy, and may be used in routine clinical practice, provided
              the limitations of the assays are taken into account. Tissue-based
              testing remains the preferred test for many cancer patients, due
              to limitations of ctDNA assays detecting fusion events and copy
              number changes, although ctDNA assays may be routinely used when
              faster results will be clinically important, or when tissue
              biopsies are not possible or inappropriate. Reflex tumour testing
              should be considered following a non-informative ctDNA result, due
              to false-negative results with ctDNA testing. In patients treated
              for early-stage cancers, detection of molecular residual disease
              or molecular relapse, has high evidence of clinical validity in
              anticipating future relapse in many cancers. Molecular residual
              disease/molecular relapse detection cannot be recommended in
              routine clinical practice, as currently there is no evidence for
              clinical utility in directing treatment. Additional potential
              applications of ctDNA assays, under research development and not
              recommended for routine practice, include identifying patients not
              responding to therapy with early dynamic changes in ctDNA levels,
              monitoring therapy for the development of resistance mutations
              before clinical progression, and in screening asymptomatic people
              for cancer. Recommendations for reporting of results, future
              development of ctDNA assays and future clinical research are made.",

              treatment and the possibility of trading quality of life (QoL) for
              length of life (LoL). Little information is available regarding
              patients' preferences and attitudes toward their cancer treatment
              and the personal costs they are prepared to exchange to extend
              their life. The aim of this review is to determine the complex
              trade-offs and underpinning factors that make patients with cancer
              choose quality over quantity of life. METHODS: A systematic review
              of the literature was conducted using MeSH terms: cancer,
              longevity or LoL, QoL, decision making, trade-off, and health
              utility. Articles retrieved were published between 1942 and
              October 2018. RESULTS: Out of 4393 articles, 30 were included in
              this review. Older age, which may be linked to declining physical
              status, was associated with a preference for QoL over LoL. Younger
              patients were more likely to undergo aggressive treatment to
              increase survival years. Preference for QoL and LoL was not
              influenced by gender, education, religion, having children,
              marital status, or type of cancer. Patients with better health
              valued LoL and inversely those with poorer physical status
              preferred QoL. CONCLUSION: Baseline QoL and future expectations of
              life seem to be key determinants of preference for QoL versus LoL
              in cancer patients. In-depth studies are required to understand
              these trade-offs and the compromises patients are willing to make
              regarding QoL or LoL, especially in older patients with naturally
              limited life expectancy.",

              of care in oncology. At the same time, it has become the object of
              increasing interest by researchers, working with both quantitative
              and qualitative methods. Progress in oncology has enabled more
              patients to survive longer, so that cancer is increasingly often a
              chronic disease that requires long-term treatment that can have
              negative effects on patients' quality of daily life. Nonetheless,
              no qualitative study has explored what patients report affects
              their quality of daily life during the treatment period. This
              study is intended to fill this gap. METHODS: We conducted a
              multicenter qualitative study based on 30 semi-structured
              interviews. Participants, purposively selected until data
              saturation, had diverse types of cancer and had started treatment
              at least 6 months before interview. Data were examined by thematic
              analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis found two themes: (1) what
              negatively affected for patient's quality of daily life during the
              treatment period, a question to which patients responded by
              talking only about the side effects of treatment; and (2) what
              positively affected their quality of daily life during the
              treatment period with three sub-themes: (i) The interest in having
              -investing in - a support object that can be defined as an object,
              a relationship or an activity particularly invested by the
              patients which makes them feel good and makes the cancer and its
              treatment bearable, (ii)The subjective perception of the efficacy
              of the antitumor treatment and (iii) the positive effects of
              relationships, with friends and family, and also with their
              physician. CONCLUSIONS: Patients must be involved in their care if
              they are to be able to bear their course of treatment and find
              ways to endure the difficult experience of cancer care. The
              support object represents an important therapeutic lever that can
              be used by their oncologists. They should be interested in their
              support objects, in order to support the patients in this

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In 1979, Marvin Zelen proposed a new design for
              randomized clinical trials intended to facilitate clinicians' and
              patients' participation. The defining innovation of Zelen's
              proposal was random assignment of treatment prior to patient or
              participant consent. Following randomization, a participant would
              receive information and asked to consent to the assigned
              treatment. METHODS: This narrative review examined recent examples
              of Zelen design trials evaluating clinical and public health
              interventions. RESULTS: Zelen designs have often been applied to
              questions regarding real-world treatment or intervention effects
              under conditions of incomplete adherence. Examples include
              evaluating outreach or engagement interventions (especially for
              stigmatized conditions), evaluating treatments for which benefit
              may vary according to participant motivation, and situations when
              assignment to a control or usual care condition might prompt a
              disappointment effect. Specific practical considerations determine
              whether a Zelen design is scientifically appropriate or
              practicable. Zelen design trials usually depend on identifying
              participants automatically from existing records rather than by
              advertising, referral, or active recruitment. Assessments of
              baseline or prognostic characteristics usually depend on available
              records data rather than research-specific assessments. Because
              investigators must consider how exposure to treatments or
              interventions might bias ascertainment of outcomes, assessment of
              outcomes from routinely created records is often necessary. A
              Zelen design requires a waiver of the usual requirement for
              informed consent prior to random assignment of treatment. The
              Revised Common Rule includes specific criteria for such a waiver,
              and those criteria are most often met for evaluation of a low-risk
              and potentially beneficial intervention added to usual care.
              Investigators and Institutional Review Boards must also consider
              whether the scientific or public health benefit of a Zelen design
              trial outweighs the autonomy interests of potential participants.
              Analysis of Zelen trials compares outcomes according to original
              assignment, regardless of any refusal to accept or participate in
              the assigned treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A Zelen design trial assesses
              the real-world consequences of a specific strategy to prompt or
              promote uptake of a specific treatment. While such trials are
              poorly suited to address explanatory or efficacy questions, they
              are often preferred for addressing pragmatic or policy questions.",

              symptoms during their illness trajectory, which can fluctuate in
              intensity. AIM: To describe the course of self-reported quality of
              life, emotional functioning, physical functioning and symptom
              intensity over time in cancer patients receiving palliative care.
              DESIGN: Longitudinal study with monthly assessments, using the
              EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL. Data were analysed (1) prospectively, from
              baseline to ‚â•8-month follow-up; and (2) retrospectively, by taking
              death as index date and comparing results from three
              cross-sectional subsamples at different stages of illness (time to
              death ‚â•6, 5-3 and 2-0 months). Linear mixed models were
              calculated. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1739 patients (mean
              age 66, 50\% male) from 30 palliative care centers in 12 countries
              were included. RESULTS: In prospective analyses, quality of life,
              functioning and symptoms-except nausea/vomiting-remained generally
              stable over time. In retrospective analyses, patients 2-0 months
              before death reported significantly lower quality of life and
              physical functioning scores than those 5-3 months before death,
              who in turn scored lower than those ‚â•6 months before death,
              suggesting progressive decline. Emotional functioning remained
              initially unchanged, but decreased in the last months. Pain,
              fatigue and appetite loss showed a stable increase in intensity
              towards death. Dyspnea, insomnia and constipation increased from
              5-3 to 2-0 months before death. Nausea/vomiting only increased
              when comparing those ‚â•6 months before death with those 2-0 months
              before death. CONCLUSION: While the prospective approach showed
              predominantly stable patterns for quality of life, functioning and
              symptom severity throughout study duration, retrospective analyses
              indicated that deterioration was already apparent before the
              terminal phase and accelerated close to death. Our findings
              support the importance of early symptom identification and
              treatment in this population, and highlight the need for further
              studies to explore what characterizes those with either lower or
              higher symptom burden at different time points towards death.",

              (RCTs) raises ethical concerns and often wastes scarce research
              resources. The epidemiology of discontinued RCTs, however, remains
              unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, characteristics,
              and publication history of discontinued RCTs and to investigate
              factors associated with RCT discontinuation due to poor
              recruitment and with nonpublication. DESIGN AND SETTING:
              Retrospective cohort of RCTs based on archived protocols approved
              by 6 research ethics committees in Switzerland, Germany, and
              Canada between 2000 and 2003. We recorded trial characteristics
              and planned recruitment from included protocols. Last follow-up of
              RCTs was April 27, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Completion
              status, reported reasons for discontinuation, and publication
              status of RCTs as determined by correspondence with the research
              ethics committees, literature searches, and investigator surveys.
              RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.6 years (range, 8.8-12.6
              years), 253 of 1017 included RCTs were discontinued (24.9\% [95\%
              CI, 22.3\%-27.6\%]). Only 96 of 253 discontinuations (37.9\% [95\%
              CI, 32.0\%-44.3\%]) were reported to ethics committees. The most
              frequent reason for discontinuation was poor recruitment
              (101/1017; 9.9\% [95\% CI, 8.2\%-12.0\%]). In multivariable
              analysis, industry sponsorship vs investigator sponsorship (8.4\%
              vs 26.5\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95\% CI, 0.15-0.43]; P < .001)
              and a larger planned sample size in increments of 100 (-0.7\%; OR,
              0.96 [95\% CI, 0.92-1.00]; P = .04) were associated with lower
              rates of discontinuation due to poor recruitment. Discontinued
              trials were more likely to remain unpublished than completed
              trials (55.1\% vs 33.6\%; OR, 3.19 [95\% CI, 2.29-4.43]; P <
              .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this sample of trials based
              on RCT protocols from 6 research ethics committees,
              discontinuation was common, with poor recruitment being the most
              frequently reported reason. Greater efforts are needed to ensure
              the reporting of trial discontinuation to research ethics
              committees and the publication of results of discontinued trials.",

              clinical trials (RCTs) approved between 2000 and 2003 were
              discontinued prematurely, and 44\% remained unpublished at a
              median of 12 years follow-up. We aimed to assess a decade later
              (1) whether rates of completion and publication have increased;
              (2) the extent to which nonpublished RCTs can be identified in
              trial registries; and (3) the association between reporting
              quality of protocols and premature discontinuation or
              nonpublication of RCTs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included 326 RCT
              protocols approved in 2012 by research ethics committees in
              Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada in this
              metaresearch study. Pilot, feasibility, and phase 1 studies were
              excluded. We extracted trial characteristics from each study
              protocol and systematically searched for corresponding trial
              registration (if not reported in the protocol) and full text
              publications until February 2022. For trial registrations, we
              searched the (i) World Health Organization: International Clinical
              Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP); (ii) US National Library of
              Medicine (ClinicalTrials.gov); (iii) European Union Drug
              Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EUCTR); (iv)
              ISRCTN registry; and (v) Google. For full text publications, we
              searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. We recorded whether
              RCTs were registered, discontinued (including reason for
              discontinuation), and published. The reporting quality of RCT
              protocols was assessed with the 33-item SPIRIT checklist. We used
              multivariable logistic regression to examine the association
              between the independent variables protocol reporting quality,
              planned sample size, type of control (placebo versus other),
              reporting of any recruitment projection, single-center versus
              multicenter trials, and industry versus investigator sponsoring,
              with the 2 dependent variables: (1) publication of RCT results;
              and (2) trial discontinuation due to poor recruitment. Of the 326
              included trials, 19 (6\%) were unregistered. Ninety-eight trials
              (30\%) were discontinued prematurely, most often due to poor
              recruitment (37\%; 36/98). One in 5 trials (21\%; 70/326) remained
              unpublished at 10 years follow-up, and 21\% of unpublished trials
              (15/70) were unregistered. Twenty-three of 147
              investigator-sponsored trials (16\%) reported their results in a
              trial registry in contrast to 150 of 179 industry-sponsored trials
              (84\%). The median proportion of reported SPIRIT items in included
              RCT protocols was 69\% (interquartile range 61\% to 77\%). We
              found no variables associated with trial discontinuation; however,
              lower reporting quality of trial protocols was associated with
              nonpublication (odds ratio, 0.71 for each 10\% increment in the
              proportion of SPIRIT items met; 95\% confidence interval, 0.55 to
              0.92; p = 0.009). Study limitations include that the moderate
              sample size may have limited the ability of our regression models
              to identify significant associations. CONCLUSIONS: We have
              observed that rates of premature trial discontinuation have not
              changed in the past decade. Nonpublication of RCTs has declined
              but remains common; 21\% of unpublished trials could not be
              identified in registries. Only 16\% of investigator-sponsored
              trials reported results in a trial registry. Higher reporting
              quality of RCT protocols was associated with publication of
              results. Further efforts from all stakeholders are needed to
              improve efficiency and transparency of clinical research.",

              foundation of medical management of metastatic melanoma. This
              study sought to determine whether circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA)
              provides useful early response and prognostic information.
              PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between
              pre-treatment and early on treatment ctDNA and outcome in melanoma
              patients treated with PD1 inhibitors alone or in combination with
              ipilimumab. RESULTS: ctDNA was detected in 40/76 patients (53\%)
              at baseline, and correlated with stage, LDH levels, disease volume
              and ECOG performance. RECIST response was 72\% (26/36) in group A
              (undetectable ctDNA at baseline), 77\% (17/22) in group B
              (elevated ctDNA at baseline but undetectable within 12 weeks of
              therapy) and 6\% (1/18) in group C (elevated ctDNA at baseline and
              remained elevated during treatment). The median PFS was not
              reached in groups A and B and was 2.7 months for group C [hazard
              ratio (HR) 0.09; P < 0.001 for group A versus C, and 0.16; P <
              0.001 for group B versus C]. The median OS was not reached for
              groups A and B and was 9.2 months for group C (HR 0.02; P < 0.001
              for group A versus C and 0.14; P < 0.001 for group B versus C).
              The poor outcome measures associated with group C remained
              significant in multivariate analysis adjusted for LDH, performance
              status, tumour stage and disease volume. The predictive value for
              ctDNA for response was confirmed in a separate validation cohort
              (n = 29, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Longitudinal assessment of ctDNA
              in metastatic melanoma patients receiving treatment with PD1
              inhibitors is an accurate predictor of tumour response, PFS and
              OS. Patients who had a persistently elevated ctDNA on therapy had
              a poor prognosis, and this may guide combination and sequencing of
              subsequent therapies.",

              time of determination of no active anti-cancer treatment to death
              at 3-6 week intervals. The KPS was determined at each time point.
              Statistical analyses with mixed effects models were performed to
              examine the association between changes in QOL, symptom distress
              and KPS at selected time points in the advanced cancer trajectory.
              Median survival for the population was 115 days, and a median of 5

              MSAS-SF and FACT-G QOL parameters started 6 months prior to death,

              any other changes, and only emotional well being reflected changes

              Self-reported data from 116 patients who all completed the
              European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality
              of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at 3, 2 and 1 month
              before death were analysed. MAIN RESULTS: All functioning aspects
              deteriorated. For physical, cognitive and social function, the
              most marked changes occurred between 2 and 1 month before death.
              The proportion reporting serious difficulties with self-care
              activities increased from 14\% to 43\%. The most seriously
              affected activity could not be distinguished from the EORTC
              QLQ-C30 scores. Levels of fatigue, dyspnoea and appetite loss
              increased significantly. More than 50\% of the patients had severe

              required to improve assessment, treatment and follow-up
              procedures. Adequate pain treatment seems still to be a challenge.

              in a real-world cohort of Dutch advanced breast cancer (ABC)
              patients. Secondary, we reported differences in QoL between

              treatment characteristics, and assessed the association of
              duration of metastatic disease and time to death with QoL.
              METHODS: ABC patients who attended the outpatient clinic between
              October 2010 and May 2011 were asked to fill out the EQ-5D-3L
              questionnaire. Patient-, disease-, and treatment characteristics

              calculated. Subgroups were described and compared for utility
              scores by parametric and non-parametric methods. RESULTS: A total
              of 92 patients were included with a median utility score of 0.691
              (Interquartile range [IQR] 0.244). Patients ‚â• 65 years had
              significantly worse median utility scores than younger patients;
              0.638 versus 0.743, respectively (p = 0.017). Moreover, scores
              were significantly worse for patients with versus those without
              comorbidity (medians 0.620 versus 0.725, p = 0.005). Utility
              scores did not significantly differ between subgroups of tumor
              type, type of systemic treatment, number of previous palliative
              treatment(s), or number or location of metastatic site(s). The
              remaining survival was correlated with utility scores (correlation
              coefficient (r) = 0.260, p = 0.0252), especially in the subgroup <
              65 years (r = 0.340, p = 0.0169), whereas there was no significant
              correlation with time since metastatic diagnosis (r = - 0.106, p =
              0.3136). CONCLUSION: Within this real-world cross-sectional study,
              QoL was significantly associated with age, comorbidity, and
              remaining survival duration. The observation of a lower QoL in ABC

              Outcomes and Measures: The 3 prespecified secondary outcomes were
              physical function, symptom control, and health-related quality of
              life (HRQOL) at 3 months, measured by the European Organisation
              for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
              (QLQ-C30; range, 0-100 points; minimum clinically important
              difference [MCID], 2-7 for physical function; no MCID defined for
              symptom control or HRQOL). Results on the primary outcome, overall

              significantly improved in the PRO group for physical function
              (PRO, from 74.27 to 75.81 points; control, from 73.54 to 72.61
              points; mean difference, 2.47 [95\% CI, 0.41-4.53]; P = .02),
              symptom control (PRO, from 77.67 to 80.03 points; control, from
              76.75 to 76.55 points; mean difference, 2.56 [95\% CI, 0.95-4.17];
              P = .002), and HRQOL (PRO, from 78.11 to 80.03 points; control,

              of secondary outcomes from a randomized clinical trial of adults
              receiving cancer treatment, use of weekly electronic PRO surveys
              to monitor symptoms, compared with usual care, resulted in
              statistically significant improvements in physical function,
              symptom control, and HRQOL at 3 months, with mean improvements of
              approximately 2.5 points on a 0- to 100-point scale. These

              interventions are delivered across varying contexts and why
              interventions work in some contexts and not in others. This
              manuscript outlines the protocol for a process evaluation embedded
              in a cluster randomised trial of a digital depression prevention
              intervention delivered to secondary school students (the Future
              Proofing Study). The purpose is to describe the methods that will
              be used to capture process evaluation data within this trial.
              METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a hybrid type 1 design, a
              mixed-methods approach will be used with data collected in the
              intervention arm of the Future Proofing Study. Data collection
              methods will include semistructured interviews with school staff
              and study facilitators, automatically collected intervention usage
              data and participant questionnaires (completed by school staff,
              school counsellors, study facilitators and students). Information
              will be collected about: (1) how the intervention was implemented
              in schools, including fidelity; (2) school contextual factors and
              their association with intervention reach, uptake and
              acceptability; (3) how school staff, study facilitators and
              students responded to delivering or completing the intervention.
              How these factors relate to trial effectiveness outcomes will also
              be assessed. Overall synthesis of the data will provide school
              cluster-level and individual-level process outcomes. ETHICS AND
              DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of
              New South Wales (NSW) Human Research Ethics Committee (HC180836;
              21st January 2019) and the NSW Government State Education Research
              Applications Process (SERAP 2019201; 19th August 2019). Results
              will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and
              discussed at conferences. Our process evaluation will
              contextualise the trial findings with respect to how the
              intervention may have worked in some schools but not in others.

              role in the development of endocrine resistance. ESR1 mutations
              are rare in primary breast cancer but have high prevalence in
              patients treated with aromatase inhibitors (AI) for advanced
              breast cancer. We investigated the evolution of genetic resistance
              to the first-line AI therapy using sequential ctDNA sampling in
              patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
              Eighty-three patients on the first-line AI therapy for metastatic
              breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study. Plasma samples
              were collected every 3 months to disease progression and ctDNA
              analysed by digital droplet PCR and enhanced tagged-amplicon
              sequencing (eTAm-Seq). Mutations identified in progression samples
              by sequencing were tracked back through samples before progression
              to study the evolution of mutations on therapy. The frequency of
              novel mutations was validated in an independent cohort of
              available baseline plasma samples in the Study of Faslodex versus
              Exemestane with or without Arimidex (SoFEA) trial, which enrolled
              patients with prior sensitivity to AI. RESULTS: Of the 39 patients
              who progressed on the first-line AI, 56.4\% (22/39) had ESR1
              mutations detectable at progression, which were polyclonal in
              40.9\% (9/22) patients. In serial tracking, ESR1 mutations were
              detectable median 6.7 months (95\% confidence interval 3.7-NA)
              before clinical progression. Utilising eTAm-Seq ctDNA sequencing
              of progression plasma, ESR1 mutations were demonstrated to be
              sub-clonal in 72.2\% (13/18) patients. Mutations in RAS genes were
              identified in 15.4\% (6/39) of progressing patients (4 KRAS, 1
              HRAS, 1 NRAS). In SoFEA, KRAS mutations were detected in 21.2\%
              (24/113) patients although there was no evidence that KRAS
              mutation status was prognostic for progression free or overall
              survival. CONCLUSIONS: Cancers progressing on the first-line AI
              show high levels of genetic heterogeneity, with frequent
              sub-clonal mutations. Sub-clonal KRAS mutations are found at high
              frequency. The genetic diversity of AI resistant cancers may limit
              subsequent targeted therapy approaches.",

              treatment for hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer
              (HR+MBC) patients. No biomarker has been validated to predict
              tumor progression in that setting. We aimed to prospectively
              compare the risk of early progression according to circulating
              ESR1 mutations, CA-15.3, and circulating cell-free DNA in MBC
              patients treated with a first-line aromatase inhibitor (AI).
              METHODS: Patients with MBC treated with a first-line AI were
              prospectively included. Circulating biomarker assessment was
              performed every 3 months. The primary objective was to determine
              the risk of progression or death at the next follow-up visit
              (after 3 months) in case of circulating ESR1 mutation detection
              among patients treated with a first-line AI for HR+MBC. RESULTS:
              Overall, 103 patients were included, and 70 (68\%) had progressive
              disease (PD). Circulating ESR1 mutations were detected in 22/70
              patients with PD and in 0/33 patients without progression (p <
              0.001). Among the ESR1-mutated patients, 18/22 had a detectable
              mutation prior to progression, with a median delay of 110 days
              from first detection to PD. The detection of circulating ESR1
              mutations was associated with a 4.9-fold (95\% CI 3.0-8.0)
              increase in the risk of PD at 3 months. Using a threshold value of
              25\% or 100\%, a CA-15.3 increase was also correlated with
              progression (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). In contrast
              to ESR1, the CA-15.3 increase occurred concomitantly with PD in
              most cases, in 27/47 (57\%) with a 25\% threshold and in 21/25
              (84\%) with a 100\% threshold. Using a threshold value of either
              25\% or 100\%, cfDNA increase was not correlated with progression.
              CONCLUSION: The emergence of circulating ESR1 mutations is
              associated with a 4.9-fold increase in the risk of early PD during
              AI treatment in HR+MBC. Our results also highlighted that tracking
              circulating ESR1 mutations is more relevant than tracking CA-15.3
              or cfDNA increase to predict progression in this setting. TRIAL

               DNA (ctDNA) from patients with colorectal cancers were correlated
               with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Next-generation
               sequencing of ctDNA (54- to 73-gene panel) was performed in 94
               patients with colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Most patients (96\%)
               had metastatic or recurrent disease at the time of blood draw.
               The median number of nonsynonymous alterations per patient was
               three (range, zero to 30). The most frequently aberrant genes
               were TP53 (52.1\% of patients), KRAS (34\%), and APC (28.7\%).
               Concordance between tissue and blood next-generation sequencing
               ranged from 63.2\% (APC) to 85.5\% (BRAF). Altogether, 74
               patients (79\%) had one or more nonsynonymous alterations, 69
               (73\%) had one or more potentially actionable alterations, and 61
               (65\%) had an alteration actionable by a drug approved by the US
               Food and Drug Administration (on or off label). Lung metastases
               correlated with improved survival from diagnosis in univariable
               analysis. ctDNA of 5\% or more from blood tests as well as EGFR
               and ERBB2 (HER2) nonsynonymous alterations correlated with worse
               survival (but only ERBB2 remained significant in multivariable
               analysis). No two patients had identical molecular portfolios.
               Overall, 65\% versus 31\% of patients treated with matched (n =
               17) versus unmatched therapy (n = 18) after ctDNA testing
               achieved stable disease for 6 months or more, partial response,
               or complete response (P = .045); progression-free survival, 6.1
               versus 2.3 months (P = .08); and survival not reached versus 9.4
               months (P = .146; all by multivariable analysis). CONCLUSION:
               Patients with colorectal cancer have heterogeneous ctDNA
               profiles, and most harbor potentially actionable ctDNA
               alterations. Matched therapy yielded higher rates of stable
               disease for 6 months or more, partial response, or complete
               response. ctDNA assessment may have clinical utility and merits

              advanced lung cancers who had no known oncogenic driver or
              developed resistance to current targeted therapy (n = 210)
              underwent plasma NGS, targeting 21 genes. A subset of patients had
              concurrent tissue NGS testing using a 468-gene panel (n = 106).
              Oncogenic driver detection, test turnaround time (TAT),
              concordance, and treatment response guided by plasma NGS were
              measured. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Somatic
              mutations were detected in 64.3\% (135/210) of patients. ctDNA
              detection was lower in patients who were on systemic therapy at

              0.5, P < .001). The median TAT of plasma NGS was shorter than
              tissue NGS (9 vs 20 days; P < .001). Overall concordance, defined
              as the proportion of patients for whom at least one identical
              genomic alteration was identified in both tissue and plasma, was
              56.6\% (60/106, 95\% CI = 46.6\% to 66.2\%). Among patients who
              tested plasma NGS positive, 89.6\% (60/67; 95\% CI = 79.7\% to
              95.7\%) were also concordant on tissue NGS and 60.6\% (60/99; 95\%
              CI = 50.3\% to 70.3\%) vice versa. Patients who tested plasma NGS
              positive for oncogenic drivers had tissue NGS concordance of
              96.1\% (49/51, 95\% CI = 86.5\% to 99.5\%), and directly led to
              matched targeted therapy in 21.9\% (46/210) with clinical

              oncogenic drivers with a shorter TAT compared with tissue NGS and
              matched patients to targeted therapy with clinical response.
              Positive findings on plasma NGS were highly concordant with tissue
              NGS and can guide immediate therapy; however, a negative finding
              in plasma requires further testing. Our findings support the
              potential incorporation of plasma NGS into practice guidelines.",

              innovative method combining systematic review of published
              studies, expert opinions and meta-analysis was used to estimate
              large, medium, and small mean changes over time for QLQ-C30
              scores. RESULTS: Nine hundred and eleven papers were identified,
              leading to 118 relevant papers. One thousand two hundred and
              thirty two mean changes in QOL over time were combined in the
              meta-analysis, with timescales ranging from four days to five
              years. Guidelines were produced for trivial, small, and medium
              size classes, for each subscale and for improving and declining
              scores separately. Estimates for improvements were smaller than
              respective estimates for declines. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines
              can be used to aid sample size calculations and interpretation of
              mean changes over time from groups of patients. Observed mean
              changes in the QLQ-C30 scores are generally small in most clinical
              situations, possibly due to response shift. Careful consideration
              is needed when planning studies where QOL changes over time are of
              primary interest; the timing of follow up, sample attrition,
              direction of QOL changes, and subscales of primary interest are
              key considerations.",

              problems in the world. In recent years, this cancer has achieved a
              reduction in mortality, which is attributed to the introduction of
              mass screening and greater efficacy of post-operative treatment.
              Many patients with breast cancer have indications only for
              palliative therapy, but the impact of these methods on the quality
              of life of patients remains a subject of controversy. It remains
              unknown whether the progress in improving the quality of life in
              clinical trials also applies to patients treated as part of daily
              clinical practice. Data on the results of the impact of conducted
              therapies on the quality of life outside of clinical trials are
              scarce. METHODS: The results of palliative chemotherapy and
              first-line hormonotherapy in 351 patients with advanced,
              metastatic breast cancer treated in the period from January 2010
              to December 2016 in two centres were analysed. RESULTS: The
              average age of patients was 62 ¬± 9.8 years; 139 patients received
              chemotherapy, 91 - therapy containing trastuzumab, and 121 -
              hormone therapy. A partial response was obtained in 111 patients
              (32\%), stabilization in 150 (43\%), and in 90 patients (26\%)
              progression. Median survival time in the whole group of patients
              was 36 months. Chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab and
              hormonotherapy was associated with greater total toxicity (p =
              0.03). There was a significant relationship between the type of
              therapy (hormonotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy) and the
              general average quality of women's life measured with the
              EORC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. In addition, a statistically
              significant difference was found in some somatic complaints (the
              scale of QLQ-BR23 symptoms) depending on the type of therapy
              performed. The lowest intensity of complaints was reported by
              patients during hormonotherapy, then during targeted therapy, and
              the largest during chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: There is no effect
              of chemotherapy on the overall quality of life. Hormone therapy
              and trastuzumab therapy improved the quality of life of the

              SETTING: Using pretreatment QLQ-C30 data (N = 3,282), we conducted
              confirmatory factor analyses to test seven previously evaluated
              higher order models. We compared the summary score(s) derived from
              the best performing higher order model with the original QLQ-C30
              scale scores, using tumor stage, performance status, and change

              published EORTC trials. Clinical anchors (eg, performance status
              [PS]) were selected using correlation strength and clinical
              plausibility of their association with a particular QLQ-C30 scale.
              Three change status groups were formed: deteriorated by one anchor
              category, improved by one anchor category, and no change. Patients
              with greater anchor changes were excluded. The mean change method

              scales, which could be considered as clinically meaningful in
              patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: WHO
              performance status (PS) and weight change were used as clinical
              anchors to determine minimal important differences (MIDs) in HRQOL
              change scores (range, 0-100) in the EORTC QLQ-C30 scales. Selected
              distribution-based methods were used for comparison. FINDINGS: In
              a pooled dataset of 812 NSCLC patients undergoing treatment, the
              values determined to represent the MID depended on whether
              patients were improving or deteriorating. MID estimates for
              improvement (based on a one-category change in PS, 5 - <20\%
              weight gain) were physical functioning (9, 5); role functioning
              (14, 7); social functioning (5, 7); global health status (9, 4);
              fatigue (14, 5); and pain (16, 2). The respective MID estimates
              for deterioration (based on PS, weight loss) were physical (4, 6);
              role (5, 5); social (7, 9); global health status (4, 4); fatigue
              (6, 11); and pain (3, 7). INTERPRETATION: Based on the selected
              QLQ-C30 scales, the MID may depend upon whether the patients' PS
              is improving or worsening, but our results are not definitive. The
              MID estimates for the specified scales can help clinicians and
              researchers evaluate the significance of changes in HRQOL and
              assess the value of a health care intervention or compare
              treatments. The estimates also can be useful in determining sample

              cancer. Coupled with next-generation sequencing, ctDNA can serve
              as an alternative substrate to tumor tissues for mutation
              detection and companion diagnostic purposes. In fact, recent
              advances in precision medicine have rapidly enabled the use of
              ctDNA to guide treatment decisions for predicting response and
              resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies. An advantage
              of using ctDNA over conventional tissue biopsies is the relatively
              noninvasive approach of obtaining peripheral blood, allowing for
              simple repeated and serial assessments. Most current clinical

              immunotherapies that have become standard of care for many elderly
              cancer patients. We used next-generation immunosequencing to study
              T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire metrics on 346 blood samples from
              healthy individuals and cancer patients producing a dataset with
              around 8.8 million TCR reads. This analysis showed that decline of
              T cell diversity and increase in T cell clonality is a continuous
              process beginning in healthy individuals over 40 years of age.
              Untreated patients with both hematological and solid tumors showed
              blood TCR repertoires with significantly lower diversity and
              higher clonality as compared to healthy individuals across all
              decades. Loss in T cell diversity was essentially driven by a loss
              in richness in aging healthy individuals, while in cancer patients
              a loss in repertoire evenness was an additional contributing
              factor. Interestingly, chemotherapy did not impair the
              regeneration of blood TCR repertoire diversity to pre-treatment
              age-specific levels. Surprisingly, even patients over the age of
              70 years receiving highly T cell toxic therapies reestablished
              their pre-treatment T cell diversity suggesting rebound thymic
              activity rather than recovery of T cell counts by peripheral
              expansion only. Taken together, these data suggest that human TCR
              repertoire metrics gradually deteriorate in the aging individual,

              metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) respond to
              immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), only a small subset of patients
              with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors have similar benefit.
              Biomarkers defining ICB-susceptible subsets of patients with MSS
              mCRPC are urgently needed. METHODS: Using next-generation T-cell
              repertoire sequencing, we explored immune signatures in 54
              patients with MSS and MSI mCRPC who were treated with or without
              ICB. We defined subset-specific immune metrics as well as T-cell
              clusters and correlated the signatures with treatment benefit.
              RESULTS: Consistent overlaps between tumor and peripheral T-cell
              repertoires suggested that blood was an informative material to
              identify relevant T-cell signatures. We found considerably higher
              blood T-cell richness and diversity and more shared T-cell
              clusters with low generation probability (pGen) in MSI versus MSS
              mCRPC, potentially reflecting more complex T-cell responses
              because of a greater neoepitope load in the MSI subset.
              Interestingly, patients with MSS mCRPC with shared low pGen T-cell
              clusters showed significantly better outcomes with ICB, but not
              with other treatments, compared with patients without such
              clusters. Blood clearance of T-cell clusters on ICB treatment
              initiation seemed to be compatible with T-cell migration to the
              primary tumor or metastatic sites during the process of clonal
              replacement as described for other tumors receiving ICB.
              CONCLUSION: The MSI mCRPC subset shows a distinct T-cell signature
              that can be detected in blood. This signature points to immune
              parameters that could help identify a subset of patients with MSS
              mCRPC who may have an increased likelihood of responding to ICB or
              to combination approaches including ICB.",

              the circulating T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire for clinical
              outcomes in GI cancers who received anti-PD-1 therapy. METHODS:
              137 pre- and 79 post-treated peripheral blood samples were
              included. The TCR repertoire was evaluated by sequencing of
              complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in the TRB gene. The
              Shannon index was used to measure the diversity of the TCR

              repertoire similarities between pre- and post-treated samples.

              with lower diversity. Moreover, patients with a higher TCR

              1.84 months; HR 13.98; 95\% CI 4.37-44.68; P < 0.001) and OS

              0.016) even in the cohort with lower baseline diversity. However,
              neither biomarker showed predictive value in the anti-PD-1

              (reducing costs, time, and resources), expanding the research
              agenda (performing trials for research questions otherwise not
              amenable to trials), and offering novel design and data collection
              options (e.g., point-of-care trials and other designs directly
              embedded in routine care). However, numerous hurdles and barriers
              must be considered pertaining to regulatory, ethical, and data
              aspects, as well as the costs of setting up the RCD
              infrastructure. Methodological considerations may be different
              from those in traditional RCTs: RCD are often collected by
              individuals not involved in the study and who are therefore
              blinded to the allocation of trial participants. Another
              consideration is that RCD trials may lead to greater
              misclassification biases or dilution effects, although these may
              be offset by randomization and larger sample sizes. Finally,
              valuable insights into external validity may be provided when
              using RCD because it allows pragmatic trials to be performed.
              METHODS: We provide an overview of the promises, challenges, and
              potential barriers, methodological implications, and research
              needs regarding RCD for RCTs. RESULTS: RCD have substantial

              RCTs, but a multidisciplinary approach is essential to address
              emerging practical barriers and methodological implications.

              adjustment has become particularly relevant in the context of the

              between three types of multiple testing: disjunction testing,

              alpha adjustment is only appropriate in the case of disjunction
              testing, in which at least one test result must be significant in
              order to reject the associated joint null hypothesis. Alpha
              adjustment is inappropriate in the case of conjunction testing, in
              which all relevant results must be significant in order to reject
              the joint null hypothesis. Alpha adjustment is also inappropriate
              in the case of individual testing, in which each individual result

              null hypothesis. The conditions under which each of these three

              of its efficiency in recruitment, advantages in reducing subject
              burden, and ability to better mimic real-world consent processes.
              METHODS: Descriptive, ethical, and US regulatory analysis of the
              Trials within Cohorts design. RESULTS: Trials within Cohorts
              design involves, after recruitment into a cohort, randomization of
              eligible subjects, followed by an asymmetric treatment of the two
              arms: those selected for the experimental arm provide informed
              consent for the intervention trial, while the data from the
              control arm are used based on prior broad permission. Thus, unlike
              the traditional Zelen post-randomization consent design, the
              cohort participants are informed about future research within the
              cohort; however, the extent of this disclosure currently varies
              among studies. Thus, ethical analysis is provided for two types of
              situations: when the pre-randomization disclosure and consent
              regarding the embedded trials are fairly explicit and detailed
              versus when they consist of only general statements about future
              data use. These differing ethical situations could have
              implications for how ethics review committees apply US research
              rules regarding waivers and alterations of informed consent.
              CONCLUSION: Trials within Cohorts is a promising new pragmatic
              randomized controlled trial design that is being increasingly used
              in various countries. Although the asymmetric consent procedures
              for the experimental versus control arm subjects can initially
              raise ethical concerns, it is ethically superior to previous
              post-randomization consent designs and can have important
              advantages over traditional trial designs.",

              undergenotyped for all eight genomic biomarkers recommended by

              comprehensive cell-free DNA (cfDNA) relative to physician
              discretion standard-of-care (SOC) tissue genotyping to identify
              guideline-recommended biomarkers in patients with mNSCLC. PATIENTS
              AND METHODS: Prospectively enrolled patients with previously
              untreated mNSCLC undergoing physician discretion SOC tissue
              genotyping submitted a pretreatment blood sample for comprehensive
              cfDNA analysis (Guardant360). RESULTS: Among 282 patients,
              physician discretion SOC tissue genotyping identified a
              guideline-recommended biomarker in 60 patients versus 77 cfDNA
              identified patients (21.3\% vs. 27.3\%; P 98.2\% with 100\%
              positive predictive value for cfDNA versus tissue (34/34 EGFR-,
              ALK-, or BRAF-positive patients). Utilizing cfDNA, in addition to
              tissue, increased detection by 48\%, from 60 to 89 patients,
              including those with negative, not assessed, or insufficient
              tissue results. cfDNA median turnaround time was significantly
              faster than tissue (9 vs. 15 days; P < 0.0001). Guideline-complete
              genotyping was significantly more likely (268 vs. 51; P < 0.0001).

              mNSCLC, a validated comprehensive cfDNA test identifies
              guideline-recommended biomarkers at a rate at least as high as SOC

              NGS for targetable mutation detection in non-small cell lung
              cancer (NSCLC) have not been formally assessed. OBJECTIVE: To
              determine whether plasma NGS testing was associated with improved
              mutation detection and enhanced delivery of personalized therapy
              in a real-world clinical setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
              PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 323 patients
              with metastatic NSCLC who had plasma testing ordered as part of
              routine clinical management. Plasma NGS was performed using a
              73-gene commercial platform. Patients were enrolled at the
              Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from April 1, 2016,
              through January 2, 2018. The database was locked for follow-up and
              analyses on January 2, 2018, with a median follow-up of 7 months
              (range, 1-21 months). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number of
              patients with targetable alterations detected with plasma and
              tissue NGS; the association between the allele fractions (AFs) of
              mutations detected in tissue and plasma; and the association of
              response rate with the plasma AF of the targeted mutations.
              RESULTS: Among the 323 patients with NSCLC (60.1\% female; median
              age, 65 years [range, 33-93 years]), therapeutically targetable
              mutations were detected in EGFR, ALK, MET, BRCA1, ROS1, RET,
              ERBB2, or BRAF for 113 (35.0\%) overall. Ninety-four patients
              (29.1\%) had plasma testing only at the discretion of the treating
              physician or patient preference. Among the 94 patients with plasma
              testing alone, 31 (33.0\%) had a therapeutically targetable
              mutation detected, thus obviating the need for an invasive biopsy.
              Among the remaining 229 patients who had concurrent plasma and
              tissue NGS or were unable to have tissue NGS, a therapeutically
              targetable mutation was detected in tissue alone for 47 patients
              (20.5\%), whereas the addition of plasma testing increased this
              number to 82 (35.8\%). Thirty-six of 42 patients (85.7\%) who
              received a targeted therapy based on the plasma result achieved a
              complete or a partial response or stable disease. The plasma-based
              targeted mutation AF had no correlation with depth of Response
              Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response (r = -0.121; P =
              .45). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Integration of plasma NGS testing
              into the routine management of stage IV NSCLC demonstrates a
              marked increase of the detection of therapeutically targetable
              mutations and improved delivery of molecularly guided therapy.",

              mosaicism in plasma remains an immense challenge for accurate

               lung cancer. In the first of two independent stages, 50 patients
               with advanced non-small cell lung cancer received pembrolizumab
               as standard of care. The primary objectives of stage 1 were to
               ascertain ctDNA response and determine optimal timing and
               concordance with radiologic Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
               Tumors (RECIST) response. Secondary endpoints included the

               fraction clearance at the third cycle of pembrolizumab signified
               molecular response (mR). The trial met its primary endpoint, with
               a sensitivity of ctDNA response for RECIST response of 82\% (90\%
               confidence interval (CI): 52‚Äì97\%) and a specificity of 75\%

               months (90\% CI: 1.5‚Äì2.6), and patients with mR attained longer
               progression-free survival (5.03 months versus 2.6 months) and

              different mental disorders benefit from exercise programs combined
              with behavior change techniques. Based on this evidence, we have
              developed an exercise program (ImPuls) specifically designed to
              provide an additional treatment option in the outpatient mental
              health care system. The implementation of such complex programs
              into the outpatient context requires research that goes beyond the
              evaluation of effectiveness, and includes process evaluation. So
              far, process evaluation related to exercise interventions has
              rarely been conducted. As part of a current pragmatic randomized
              controlled trial evaluating ImPuls treatment effects, we are
              therefore carrying out comprehensive process evaluation according
              to the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework. The central aim
              of our process evaluation is to support the findings of the
              ongoing randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The process
              evaluation follows a mixed-methods approach. We collect
              quantitative data via online-questionnaires from patients,
              exercise therapists, referring healthcare professionals and
              managers of outpatient rehabilitative and medical care facilities
              before, during, and after the intervention. In addition,
              documentation data as well as data from the ImPuls smartphone
              application are collected. Quantitative data is complemented by
              qualitative interviews with exercise therapists as well as a
              focus-group interview with managers. Treatment fidelity will be
              assessed through the rating of video-recorded sessions.
              Quantitative data analysis includes descriptive as well as
              mediation and moderation analyses. Qualitative data will be
              analyzed via qualitative content analysis. DISCUSSION: The results
              of our process evaluation will complement the evaluation of
              effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and will, for example,
              provide important information about mechanisms of impact,
              structural prerequisites, or provider qualification that may
              support the decision-making process of health policy stakeholders.
              It might contribute to paving the way for exercise programs like
              ImPuls to be made successively available for patients with

              are relatively common, although the extent to which they lead to
              biased claims is impossible to empirically establish. These
              practices are amplified by publication bias, where desired results

              how, from an error-statistical epistemology, the goal of
              preregistration is to allow peers to transparently evaluate how
              severely a claim has been tested, and how the goal of Registered

              research on preregistration and Registered Reports confirms both
              practices achieve these goals. The literature also reveals
              researchers perceive additional benefits of preregistration,

              criticisms on preregistration, and find conflicting viewpoints,
              several misunderstandings, and a general lack of empirical
              support. An exception is the valid concern that the mere presence
              of a preregistration will mindlessly be used as a proxy for high

              process evaluations reported separately and process data reported
              in the trial results papers. We extracted and analysed
              quantitative and qualitative data to answer review objectives.
              RESULTS: From an index sample of 31 pragmatic RCTs, we identified
              17 separate process evaluation studies. These had varied
              characteristics and only three were labelled 'process evaluation'.
              Each of the 31 trial results papers also reported process data,
              with a median of five different process evaluation components per
              trial. Reported barriers and facilitators related to real-world
              collection of process data, recruitment of participants to process
              evaluations, and health services research regulations. We
              synthesised a wide range of reported benefits of process
              evaluations to interventions, trials, and wider knowledge.
              Visibility was often poor, with 13/17 process evaluations not
              mentioned in the trial results paper and 12/16 process evaluation
              journal articles not appearing in the trial registry. CONCLUSIONS:
              In our sample of reviewed pragmatic RCTs, the meaning of the label
              'process evaluation' appears uncertain, and the scope and
              significance of the term warrant further research and
              clarification. Although there were many ways in which the process
              evaluations added value, they often had poor visibility. Our
              findings suggest approaches that could enhance the planning and
              utility of process evaluations in the context of pragmatic RCTs.

              discuss some of the current challenges and future prospects in
              cancer therapy. We frequently use the example of lung cancer.
              METHODS: We conducted a nonsystematic PubMed search, selecting the
              most comprehensive and relevant research articles, clinical
              trials, translational papers, and review articles on precision
              oncology and immuno-oncology. Papers were prioritized and selected
              based on their originality and potential clinical applicability.
              FINDINGS: Two major revolutions have changed cancer treatment
              paradigms in the past few years: targeting actionable alterations
              in oncogene-driven cancers and immuno-oncology. Important
              challenges are still ongoing in both fields of cancer therapy. On
              the one hand, druggable genomic alterations are diverse and
              represent only small subsets of patients in certain tumor types,
              which limits testing their clinical impact in biomarker-driven
              clinical trials. Next-generation sequencing technologies are
              increasingly being implemented for molecular prescreening in
              clinical research, but issues regarding clinical interpretation of
              large genomic data make their wide clinical use difficult.
              Further, dealing with tumor heterogeneity and acquired resistance
              is probably the main limitation for the success of precision
              oncology. On the other hand, long-term survival benefits with
              immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed death cell
              protein-1/programmed death cell ligand-1[PD-1/L1] and
              anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 monoclonal antibodies) are
              restricted to a minority of patients, and no predictive markers
              are yet robustly validated that could help us recognize these
              subsets and optimize treatment delivery and selection. To achieve
              long-term survival benefits, drug combinations targeting several
              molecular alterations or cancer hallmarks might be needed. This
              will probably be one of the most challenging but promising
              precision cancer treatment strategies in the future. IMPLICATIONS:
              Targeting single molecular abnormalities or cancer pathways has
              achieved good clinical responses that have modestly affected
              survival in some cancers. However, this approach to cancer
              treatment is still reductionist, and many challenges need to be
              met to improve treatment outcomes with our patients.",

               reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal.
               Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the
               reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract
               information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological
               analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are
               associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such
               systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are
               considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because
               of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists
               and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of
               Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting
               of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The
               statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors
               can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and
               major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT
               statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and
               interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it
               became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles
               underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and
               others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation
               and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001
               version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in
               January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and
               is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves
               the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and
               incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only
               recently received recognition, such as selective outcome

              with careful consideration of context is essential for successful
              implementation science projects. Although the importance of
              context has been emphasized and methodology for its analysis is
              emerging, researchers have little guidance on how to plan,
              perform, and report contextual analysis. Therefore, our aim was to
              describe the Basel Approach for coNtextual ANAlysis (BANANA) and
              to demonstrate its application on an ongoing multi-site,
              multiphase implementation science project to develop/adapt,
              implement, and evaluate an integrated care model in allogeneic
              SteM cell transplantatIon facILitated by eHealth (the SMILe
              project). METHODS: BANANA builds on guidance for assessing context
              by Stange and Glasgow (Contextual factors: the importance of
              considering and reporting on context in research on the
              patient-centered medical home, 2013). Based on a literature
              review, BANANA was developed in ten discussion sessions with
              implementation science experts and a medical anthropologist to
              guide the SMILe project's contextual analysis. BANANA's
              theoretical basis is the Context and Implementation of Complex
              Interventions (CICI) framework. Working from an ecological
              perspective, CICI acknowledges contextual dynamics and
              distinguishes between context and setting (the implementation's
              physical location). RESULTS: BANANA entails six components: (1)
              choose a theory, model, or framework (TMF) to guide the contextual
              analysis; (2) use empirical evidence derived from primary and/or
              secondary data to identify relevant contextual factors; (3)
              involve stakeholders throughout contextual analysis; (4) choose a
              study design to assess context; (5) determine contextual factors'
              relevance to implementation strategies/outcomes and intervention
              co-design; and (6) report findings of contextual analysis
              following appropriate reporting guidelines. Partly run
              simultaneously, the first three components form a basis both for
              the identification of relevant contextual factors and for the next
              components of the BANANA approach. DISCUSSION: Understanding of
              context is indispensable for a successful implementation science
              project. BANANA provides much-needed methodological guidance for
              contextual analysis. In subsequent phases, it helps researchers
              apply the results to intervention development/adaption and choices
              of contextually tailored implementation strategies. For future
              implementation science projects, BANANA's principles will guide
              researchers first to gather relevant information on their target
              context, then to inform all subsequent phases of their
              implementation science project to strengthen every part of their
              work and fulfill their implementation goals.",

              clinical trial stakeholders from three different countries
              regarding reasons for recruitment failure in RCTs and (2) how
              these compare and contrast with the causes identified in a
              previous systematic review of RCT publications. METHODS: From
              August 2015 to November 2016, we conducted 49 semi-structured
              interviews with a purposive sample of clinical trial stakeholders.

              (n = 6) and Canada (n = 1) with personal experience of a
              discontinued RCT and 33 other stakeholders (e.g., representatives
              of ethics committees, clinical trial units, pharmaceutical
              industry) in Switzerland. Individual semi-structured qualitative
              interviews were conducted and analyzed using thematic analysis.
              RESULTS: Interviewees identified a total of 29 different reasons
              for recruitment failure. Overoptimistic recruitment estimates, too
              narrow eligibility criteria, lack of engagement of
              recruiters/trial team, lack of competence/training/experience of
              recruiters, insufficient initial funding, and high burden for

              being revised and a new category describing research
              environment-related factors being added. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              highlights the diversity of often interlinked reasons for
              recruitment failure in RCTs. Integrating the findings of this
              interview study with a previous systematic review of RCT
              publications led to a comprehensive, structured checklist of
              empirically-informed reasons for recruitment failure. The
              checklist may be useful to guide further research on interventions
              to improve participant recruitment in RCTs and helpful for trial
              investigators, research ethics committees, and funding agencies
              when assessing trial feasibility with respect to recruitment.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold
              standard for generating evidence to inform clinical oncology
              practice. Knowledge gained through qualitative research
              methodologies can be complementary to that gained through RCTs.
              How qualitative research has been combined with RCTs in oncology
              has not been previously characterized. OBJECTIVE: This scoping
              review was conducted to summarize how qualitative research
              associated with RCTs in the oncology setting has been conducted
              and examine the quality of reporting. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
              Manuscripts reporting on qualitative research linked with RCTs in
              the cancer context that involved patients (both adult and
              pediatric) and/or informal caregiver (friends/family) were
              included. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: Peer-reviewed manuscripts indexed
              in MEDLINE (OVID) and CINAHL, published in English between 2008
              and January 2019. CHARTING METHODS: Formal scoping review methods
              were followed. A data extraction tool informed by the research
              questions as well as the COnsolidated criteria for REporting
              Qualitative research (COREQ) was utilized. Extraction was
              conducted independently by two authors, with disagreements
              resolved by a third. RESULTS: Fifty-four articles were included.
              Assessing information sharing, diet/exercise, and
              psychotherapeutic interventions were the most common focuses of
              the RCTs. The most common focus of the qualitative component was
              on gaining insight into the experience of receiving the
              intervention or participating in RCT procedures. How the
              intervention impacted the cancer experience was not a common focus
              of the qualitative components. Some reports provided insufficient
              information to understand how the qualitative components aligned
              with the RCT components. The results of the qualitative and RCT
              components were not integrated to draw meaningful conclusions
              about the efficacy of the intervention under study in most cases.
              Reports focusing on only qualitative methods had higher median
              (Mdn) reporting of COREQ items compared to reports that included
              both the qualitative and RCT components (Mdn = 18 vs. Mdn = 14,
              respectively; p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This review identified that
              qualitative research has been combined with RCTs in the cancer
              context in a number of ways, most commonly to understand the
              experience of receiving study interventions or participating in
              trial procedures. Exploring how interventions impact other aspects
              of the cancer experience is an approach that should be considered
              in future work. Formalized guidelines for the design and reporting
              of investigations that combine qualitative and RCT approaches in
              the cancer context are expected to be of value. TWEETABLE

               Imputation may be performed using a regression model for the
               incomplete covariates on other covariates and, importantly, on
               the outcome. With a survival outcome, it is a common practice to
               use the event indicator D and the log of the observed event or
               censoring time T in the imputation model, but the rationale is
               not clear.We assume that the survival outcome follows a
               proportional hazards model given covariates X and Z. We show that
               a suitable model for imputing binary or Normal X is a logistic or
               linear regression on the event indicator D, the cumulative
               baseline hazard H(0)(T), and the other covariates Z. This result

               it by Cox regression.We compare the methods using simulation

               associations towards the null, while the new methods have lower
               bias. Overall, we recommend including the event indicator and the
